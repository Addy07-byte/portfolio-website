          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m <strong>Aditya Hede</strong>, IT Graduate Student passionate about building secure, scalable systems that drive innovation. My expertise lies in <span class="tag">AWS</span>, <span class="tag">CI/CD</span>, <span class="tag">IaC</span>, and <span class="tag">DevOps</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a Master’s degree in Information Technology from <strong>Arizona State University</strong>, where I focused on cloud architecture, automation, data analytics and cybersecurity. With both academic knowledge and hands-on experience, I’ve built everything from serverless healthcare platforms to monitored VPC-hosted applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in automation, observability, and doing things the right way the first time. I’m constantly expanding my skills through cloud certifications and open-source collaboration.
